What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

    Interfaces and Types are used for defining type in typescript but they have few differences too.
    * Interfaces can define type only for non premetive types where types can define all premitive and non premitives.
    *Interface can use extends keyword to inherit types from another interface where type does using intersections.
